-----------------------------------------
# Key Insights

* Customers left: 1,655 customers churned in the last month.
* Gender distribution: The female-to-male customer ratio is almost equal at 49.5% to 50.5%.

# Plan distribution:

* 166 customers are on a 1-year plan.
* No internet service: 1,526 customers (21.7% of the total) do not have internet service.
* Technical issues: 970 customers had at least one tech ticket.

# Customer tenure:

# Dependents and partners:

# Based on these findings, I would suggest the following actions:

* Promote yearly plans: Offering more incentives to shift monthly plan users to 1-year or 2-year plans could help improve retention.
* Target customers without Internet service: With 21.7% of customers not using Internet service, attractive internet service options could increase engagement and reduce churn.
* Proactive renewal reminders: We should send reminder emails to monthly plan customers before their plan expires, encouraging renewal and possibly offering a discount for committing to a longer-term strategy.
